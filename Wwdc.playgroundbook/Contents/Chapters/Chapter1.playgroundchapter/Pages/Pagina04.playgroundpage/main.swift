 #About me
 In a nutshell, I'm me Haha. I currently participate in the Apple Academy program and study at IFCE. I have a dog named Bethoven, a big family and I like to learn new things about people, music and technology.
 
 Speaking of which, the subject of this project was motivated by my teacher Thiago Queiroz and the program that showed me many interesting things in the last few months. I learned that the infinity of the human mind is incredible and how we can help each other solve problems. The initial image of this project shows how we think differently, but we can get closer, empathize with people and share good times.
