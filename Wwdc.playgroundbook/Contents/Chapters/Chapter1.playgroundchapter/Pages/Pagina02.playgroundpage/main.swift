 # Enlarging Text
 
Vision is a very important sense to pay attention to when thinking about an accessible app. One of the tips I want to comment on is the increase in letters and characters.

- Important:
    Vision problems can be diverse and, according to an IBGE survey, about 19% of the world population has some type of visual impairment, which impairs many of their daily tasks.

People with low vision need optical help, such as glasses, simple magnifying glasses, among other things, and also non-optical help, such as enlarged texts. That's right, a simple feature can make a lot of difference, but for you to understand better, how about experimenting?
 
 * Experiment:
    1. Identify the magnifying glass on the opposite page
    2. Click on the magnifying glass
    3. Repeat step "2" three more times to see the different sizes

For the different sizes of this text, I used part of the accessibility category used by Apple on its devices.
